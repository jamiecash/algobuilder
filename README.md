# algobuilder
AlgoBuilder is a python application for building and running your algo-trading strategies. Algobuilder supports:
* Plugin datasources for collecting price data;
* Plugin feature calculations to build the features that your algo-trading strategies will use; and
* Plugin strategies to calculate trading recommendations from your calculated features.

## Architecture
AlgoBuilder is a distributed application consisting of:
* A web front end for configuring your price data source, features, and strategies; and for viewing output.
* A messaging server;
* Task processors for price data retrieval; feature calculation; and strategy execution.
* A database to store price data, features and the output from your algo trading strategies.

## Setup
1) Set up your python environment.
2) Set up an empty postgresql database.
3) Set up a RabbitMQ messaging server.   
4) Install the required libraries.

```shell
pip install -r algobuilder/requirements.txt
```

5) Set your database and message server connection parameters by renaming settings_local.example.py to settings_local.py and setting [db_username], [db_password], [rabbitmq_username] and [rabbitmq_password] to your database and message server usernames and passwords. Change the host if your database and message server is not on localhost.

6) Generate a secret  key and store in your local settings file in the [secret_key] placeholder. A secure keyu can be generated by running:

```shell
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

7) Build the applications' database. If you get any errors, try commenting out the urlpatterns in algobuilder/urls first.

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

9) Create your admin superuser.
```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

10) Launch the applications web server.
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

11) Once AlgoBuilder has been set up, you will need to: retrieve price data; calculate features; and calculate trading recommendations. The instructions for these steps are available below:
